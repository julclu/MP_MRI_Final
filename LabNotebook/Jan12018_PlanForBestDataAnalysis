1. Everything needs to be manually checked and done consistently.
2. All of the MRI processing has been done for the old data, but I need to: 
    a. Create batch anatomical svk_roi_analysis for those with and without t1va files. 
    b. Create batch diffusion svk_roi_analysis. 
    c. Move all perf_biopsy information over from /data/bioe4/po1_preop_recur & write script to collect data (done).
    d. Re-run spectroscopy analysis using Sarah's scripts on all data. 
3. Once this is complete, we need to manually QC each biopsy: 
    a. Is it in the ventricles? Is it in a hematoma? Is it in the dura? 
    b. What is the primary outcome? QC each outcome assignment as TxE or rHGG using path notes & scores.  
    c. Do necrosis scores line up with necrosis imaging? 
4. Finally, with a list of good biopsies that represent the true imaging and the true outcome, we can try to associate outcome with imaging parameters: 
    a. Create boxplots and histograms that represent the biopsy imaging parameters by category of outcome
    b. Use RMANOVA, GLMM, GEE to associate parameters with outcome
    c. Use complete data (all MR parameters complete) to attempt to classify via random forest
    d. Write up results.
